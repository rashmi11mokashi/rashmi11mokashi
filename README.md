Experienced Backend Design Developer specializing in machine learning model building for Motorcycle Electronics Systems. 

In my two years at Yamaha, I developed machine learning models using Python and SQL, focusing on neural networks, reinforcement learning, and recommendation systems. I managed the entire data lifecycle, from collection and cleaning to advanced imputation techniques and creating data flow diagrams. 

I built neural networks from scratch, fine-tuned models, and applied feature engineering techniques like one-hot encoding and text vectorization. I created Quality Function Deployment charts to align user needs with system functions and conducted rigorous model testing, including hyperparameter tuning and edge case analysis. Currently, I am working on an incremental learning project with a focus on knowledge distillation and gradient adjustments in neural network layers.

 In the Design Planning Division, I specialize in Quality Function Deployment, Systems Design, and Architecture. Committed to staying ahead, I am currently preparing for AWS certification to venture into Cloud computing, aligning with the evolving tech landscape.
